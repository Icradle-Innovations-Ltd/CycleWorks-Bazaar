# Stock Market Signal Processing Web App (CycleWorks)

## Define Clear Objectives

The Stock Market Signal Processing web app is designed with the following objectives:

1. **Analyze Stock Price Data**: Utilize Fourier Transforms to detect periodic patterns or cycles in historical stock price data, helping users identify recurring market trends.
2. **Visualize Insights**: Offer interactive visualizations of the time series data and its power spectrum, making it easier for users to interpret frequency components and market behavior.
3. **Educate Users**: Act as an educational tool to teach signal processing techniques applied to financial data, with a focus on understanding Fourier Transforms and their relevance to stock market cycles.

This application solves the problem of making complex signal processing accessible to learners and enthusiasts interested in financial data analysis.

## Plan the Development Process

### Research

- **Theoretical Concepts**: Investigate Fourier Transform fundamentals, focusing on how they decompose time series data into frequency components, and their specific application to stock price analysis.

- **Existing Solutions**: Review tools or libraries (e.g., TA-Lib, QuantLib) that perform stock market analysis using signal processing, identifying gaps the project can address.

### Design

- **Architecture**: Build a web application with Flask as the backend to process data and serve results, paired with Plotly for interactive frontend visualizations.

- **User Interface**: Develop a simple, user-friendly interface allowing users to upload CSV files containing stock data (with "date" and "price" columns) and view analysis results.

### Implementation

- **Modular Code**: Structure the codebase into distinct modules:
  - Data processing (e.g., loading CSV files, applying FFT)
  - Visualization (e.g., generating time series and power spectrum plots)
  - Web routing (e.g., Flask routes for handling uploads and displaying results)
- **Clear Documentation**: Include inline code comments explaining key steps (e.g., FFT computation) and a project report summarizing the development process.

### Testing

- **Validation**: Test the app with diverse stock price datasets to confirm accurate detection of cycles and patterns.

- **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios like missing data, non-numeric inputs, or irregular time intervals, ensuring robust performance.

## Use Appropriate Tools

### Programming Languages

- **Python**: Chosen as the core language due to its versatility, extensive library ecosystem, and suitability for data analysis and web development.

### Libraries

- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations, including the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency components.

- **SciPy**: Provides advanced signal processing capabilities, enhancing FFT implementation.

- **Pandas**: Facilitates reading and manipulating CSV files containing stock data.

- **Plotly**: Preferred over Matplotlib for its interactive visualization features, enabling users to explore time series and power spectra dynamically.

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework to manage backend logic, such as processing uploaded files and rendering results.

**Note**: While libraries like pyaudio, scikit-image, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow are powerful, they are not directly relevant to this project's scope, which focuses on signal processing and visualization rather than audio, image processing, or machine learning.

## Document the Process

### Project Report

Create a comprehensive document detailing:
- **Learning Journey**: Insights gained about Fourier Transforms and their financial applications.

- **Challenges Faced**: Issues like handling irregular time series data or interpreting noisy frequency spectra.

- **Solutions Implemented**: Techniques such as data interpolation for missing values or detrending to remove long-term trends before FFT analysis.

- **Code Comments**: Embed clear, concise comments within the code to explain functionality, making it reusable and understandable for others.

## Collaborate and Share

- **Teamwork**: Encourage collaboration by dividing tasks (e.g., one person focuses on data processing, another on visualization) if working in a group.

- **Version Control**: Utilize Git for tracking changes, managing contributions, and maintaining a project history. Host the repository on platforms like GitHub to share ideas and code with others.

## Additional Considerations

- **Data Assumptions**: The app expects CSV files with "date" and "price" columns. Users should be informed of this format for smooth operation.

- **Optional Enhancements**: Future iterations could include detrending the time series, integrating real-time stock data APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance), or adding educational tooltips about signal processing concepts.

This approach ensures the Stock Market Signal Processing web app meets the guidelines, delivering a functional, educational, and well-documented tool for analyzing stock market data.

This document outlines the project structure, use cases, tools, and implementation details for a web application that processes stock market data using signal processing techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a Flask-based web application with distinct frontend and backend components:

```python
stock-market-signal-processing/
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── static/                # Static assets
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css     # Stylesheet
│   └── js/
│       └── main.js       # Client-side JavaScript
├── templates/            # HTML templates
│   ├── index.html       # Upload page
│   └── results.html     # Results display page
└── utils/               # Utility modules
    ├── data_processing.py  # Data loading and FFT logic
    └── visualization.py    # Plotly visualization generation
```

- **app.py**: Handles routing, file uploads, and template rendering.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists Python packages required for the project.
- **static/**: Contains CSS and JavaScript files for the frontend.
- **templates/**: Stores HTML files for the user interface.
- **utils/**: Includes Python modules for data processing and visualization.

## Use Cases

The web app supports the following user interactions:

1. **Upload Stock Data**

   - Users upload a CSV file with "date" and "price" columns containing historical stock data.

2. **Visualize Time Series**

   - Users view an interactive plot of stock prices over time.

3. **Analyze Frequency Components**

   - Users see the power spectrum of the stock data, highlighting dominant cycles.

4. **Interpret Results**

   - Users receive a list of top dominant cycles (periods and strengths) for market analysis.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries are required:

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the app.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations, including FFT.
- **SciPy**: Signal processing capabilities (FFT module).
- **Pandas**: CSV file handling and data manipulation.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations.
